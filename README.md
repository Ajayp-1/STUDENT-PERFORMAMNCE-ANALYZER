# STUDENT-PERFORMAMNCE-ANALYZER

This is a simple Python Data Analysis project that generates random student performance data (marks in subjects + attendance), analyzes it in memory (without file handling), and visualizes insights using NumPy + Matplotlib.
The project helps practice:
. Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
. Data analysis (averages, correlation)
. Data visualization bar charts, scatter plots)
